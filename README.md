# WEATHER APP

This weather app allows you to enter a city and have the current weather and a 5 day forecast pop up.
Upon entering a city a button is added for easily accessing the weather in in the future.

The app utilizes 3 weather APIs.

The city searches are stored in local storage to allow the user to grab them again after page reload.]

The page will load the last city entered in the text field upon reload of the page.

had issues with scope in the JS.  Everytime I tried to condence the JS into functions to clean things up i would run into scope issues that i could not identify a solution for.

An HTML frame work was created and most of the weather data is dynamically generated through JS.

I am very happy with the design although i would have done more if the JS went easier than it did.

Cheers
